"""A TAK Server restart during boot no longer takes the stack down (v10.2.5, GH #83).

Field (v10.2.4, Ubuntu 22.04): the console's startup migration healed the LDAP
service account and restarted TAK Server at 106 s uptime. tak-boot-sequencer.sh
treated it as another boot (uptime < 600 s) and stopped every container — but what
it stops is restored only by tak-post-start.service, a oneshot that runs once per
boot and had already brought Authentik back. Authentik and TAK Portal stayed down
~12 minutes, and the 8089 client gate was re-engaged with nothing left to release it.

The REAL sequencer runs here with its absolute paths pointed into a sandbox and
docker/systemctl stubbed; every call it makes is recorded.
